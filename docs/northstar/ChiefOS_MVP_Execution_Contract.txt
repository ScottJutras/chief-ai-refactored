CHIEFOS MVP EXECUTION CONTRACT
Status: LOCKED ON APPROVAL
Audience: Product, Engineering, Security, Investors
Purpose: Define the smallest enforceable slice of ChiefOS that must work end-to-end to deliver the MVP magic moment without eroding trust, privacy, or system integrity.

1) MVP GOAL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Within 5–10 minutes, a business owner can:
1. Upload messy, real business data
2. Stream a few real activities via WhatsApp
3. Ask an unscripted question about their business
4. Receive either:
   - a truthful, grounded answer based only on ingested data, or
   - an explicit admission of missing or insufficient data

If the system answers confidently without sufficient data, the MVP has failed.
Trust is the product.

2) CORE PRINCIPLES (ENFORCED, NOT ASPIRATIONAL)
2.1 One Mind, Many Senses
- Exactly ONE reasoning interface (Chief) per business
- Unlimited ingestion identities (employees, contractors)
- No multi-user chat
- No reasoning in ingestion channels

2.2 Separation of Duties
- Ingestion captures facts only
- Chief performs all reasoning, explanations, and summaries
- Ingestion channels may confirm what was recorded, nothing more

2.3 Trust Over Cleverness
- No data fabrication
- No inferred facts without explicit labeling
- Missing data must be stated clearly
- Uncertainty is surfaced, not hidden

2.4 Privacy & Security by Default
- Strict tenant isolation
- Least-privilege ingestion identities
- Full audit trail on every mutation
- No cross-tenant reasoning or retrieval

3) MVP SYSTEM BOUNDARIES
3.1 Included in MVP

A) Ingestion Layer (The Senses)
- WhatsApp (Twilio)
  - Text messages
  - Images (receipts)
- Document upload (PDFs, images, spreadsheets)

Ingestion responsibilities:
- Normalize input
- Produce Canonical Intermediate Language (CIL)
- Persist records
- Return confirmation with record IDs

B) Chief (The Brain)
- Single web interface (owner only)
- Read-only advisory mode
- Unscripted natural-language questions
- Tool-based reasoning only

3.2 Explicitly Out of Scope (MVP)
Not allowed in MVP, even if “easy”:
- Multi-user reasoning or chat
- Employee questions or analytics
- Forecasting or projections
- AI suggestions without data grounding
- Auto-actions (sending invoices, moving money)
- Broad dashboards or KPI libraries
- Integrations beyond WhatsApp + uploads

4) THE MVP MAGIC MOMENT (TESTABLE)
The MVP must pass this real-world test:
1. Owner uploads 10–30 real business files (receipts, invoices, spreadsheets)
2. Owner or employee sends 5–10 WhatsApp messages (expenses, time, notes)
3. Owner asks Chief:
   - “Which jobs are making me money?” or
   - “Why does cash feel tight this month?”
4. Chief responds with:
   - A structured explanation grounded only in ingested records
   - Explicit assumptions and data gaps
   - Zero hallucinated facts

If this cannot be demoed reliably, the MVP is incomplete.

5) DATA TRUST GUARANTEE
Chief may only reason over:
- Uploaded documents
- WhatsApp-ingested activity
- Explicit owner input

Chief must not:
- Use priors about “typical businesses”
- Infer totals without complete data
- Smooth over missing information

Required pattern when data is insufficient:
“I don’t have enough data to answer that yet. Here’s what’s missing…”

6) TECHNICAL ENFORCEMENTS (MVP MINIMUM)
Build-blocking requirements:
- Idempotent ingestion (source_msg_id)
- Postgres with strict Row Level Security (owner_id)
- Append-only audit table
- Canonical Intermediate Language (CIL) for all ingress
- Tool-only reasoning (no free-text DB access)
- Provider-agnostic LLM abstraction
- Rate limits and per-tenant budgets

7) SUCCESS CRITERIA
MVP is successful when:
- Owners trust answers more than dashboards
- The system refuses to answer when it should
- Engineers cannot accidentally break trust guarantees
- The product feels boringly correct, not impressively clever

8) LOCK STATEMENT
Once approved, this Execution Contract:
- Cannot be overridden by engineering shortcuts
- Cannot be expanded without explicit re-approval
- Serves as the source of truth for scope disputes

ChiefOS MVP builds understanding — not features.
