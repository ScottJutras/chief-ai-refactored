# Job Management Software Landscape (ServiceTitan, Jobber, Housecall Pro)

PocketCFO is not a job management platform. It is a financial intelligence
layer that sits on top of tools like Jobber, ServiceTitan, and Housecall Pro.

## 1. Quick Profiles

**ServiceTitan**
- Position: Enterprise-grade field service platform.
- Strengths: Very comprehensive feature set; strong customer support; deep
  integrations; good for larger teams with office staff.
- Tradeoffs: Expensive, heavier implementation, more complex to adopt.

**Jobber**
- Position: Easy-to-use job management for small and mid-sized service businesses.
- Strengths: Clean, intuitive interface; strong ease-of-use; great for small
  contractors getting organised.
- Tradeoffs: Focused on scheduling, dispatching, and basic invoicing – limited
  financial insight and advanced job profitability analytics.

**Housecall Pro**
- Position: Job management and scheduling for door-to-door service businesses.
- Strengths: Routing and scheduling, automated customer notifications, good
  perceived value for money.
- Tradeoffs: Lower likelihood-to-recommend scores than the others; still more
  about running jobs than understanding profit and cash.

## 2. What They All Have in Common

All three:
- Handle scheduling, dispatching, CRM, and job workflows.
- Provide quoting and invoicing features.
- Help teams coordinate in the field.

None of them:
- Focus on deep job costing and gross margin analysis.
- Explain cash flow, debtor days, or working capital.
- Coach users on when to raise prices, hire, or seek funding.
- Act like a CFO for the owner.

## 3. PocketCFO’s Position

PocketCFO + Chief:

- Works *alongside* any job management tool – we do not replace them.
- Focuses on profit, cash flow, and financial clarity.
- Translates raw activity (timeclock, invoices, expenses) into:
  - profit per job and per crew,
  - margin trends,
  - cash flow forecasts,
  - pricing and growth recommendations.

Simple message:

> “Use Jobber, ServiceTitan, or Housecall Pro to run the jobs.
> Use PocketCFO and Chief to run the business.”

## 4. How Chief Should Answer Comparison Questions

When asked “How is this different from Jobber / ServiceTitan / Housecall Pro?”:

- Acknowledge their strengths (scheduling, dispatch, CRM).
- Reiterate that PocketCFO is a *CFO assistant*, not a replacement.
- Explain we plug into existing systems (or run off exports) to compute KPIs.
- Bring the conversation back to profit, cash, and decisions, not just features.
