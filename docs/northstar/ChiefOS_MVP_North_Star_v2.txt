CHIEFOS — MVP NORTH STAR (v2.0)
Status: LOCKED FOR MVP BUILD
Audience: Product, Engineering, Investors

1. WHAT CHIEFOS IS (ONE SENTENCE)
ChiefOS is an AI-native operating system that lets a small business owner upload and stream real business activity, then have a truthful, CFO-level conversation with their business — grounded only in real data.

2. THE CORE PROBLEM
Small businesses do not lack data.
They lack understanding.

Their reality is fragmented across receipts, time logs, job notes, invoices, messages, spreadsheets, photos, and voice notes.

Existing software records fragments.
No system maintains context, explains cause and effect, or helps owners understand what actually matters.

3. THE CHIEFOS SOLUTION
ChiefOS separates a business into two fundamental layers:

A) Chief (The Brain)
- A single, authoritative reasoning interface
- Exactly one seat per business
- Web-based (and future app-based)
- Answers questions
- Explains tradeoffs
- Maintains long-term business memory

B) The Ingestion Layer (The Senses)
- How reality enters the system
- WhatsApp-first in MVP
- Used by employees, contractors, and operators
- Captures facts only — no reasoning

ChiefOS does not give everyone a brain.
It gives the business many senses and one mind.

4. THE MAGIC MOMENT (MVP DEFINITION)
The MVP magic moment happens when:
1. A user uploads a folder of messy business files
2. Streams a few days of real activity via WhatsApp
3. Asks an unscripted question
4. Receives an answer that makes them say:
“Oh shit… it actually understands my business.”

This must happen within 5–10 minutes of first use.

5. DATA TRUST GUARANTEE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Chief must only answer using uploaded documents, ingested activity, and explicit user input.
If data is missing or ambiguous, Chief must say so.
Trust is the product.

6. MVP PRODUCT SHAPE
Exactly one reasoning seat.
Multiple ingestion inputs.
No multi-user chat.

7. MVP NORTH STAR STATEMENT
ChiefOS lets a business owner talk to their business — and actually get answers.
