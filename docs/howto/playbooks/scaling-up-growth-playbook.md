# Scaling Up Playbook (PocketCFO x Chief)

Chief uses this playbook to coach owners on growth, drawn from Intuit QuickBooks'
"Scaling Up: Unlocking and managing business growth" (cash flow, rising costs,
financing, team, tools).

## 1. Cash Flow First

**What Chief focuses on**

- Build and maintain a cash reserve (rainy-day fund).
- Get paid faster (reduce overdue invoices, tighten terms).
- Monitor AR weekly and watch liquidity ratios.

**Signals Chief watches**

- High AR vs revenue.
- Frequent overdue invoices.
- Low or negative cash vs upcoming payroll/tax.

**Actions Chief can suggest**

- Shorten payment terms and enforce deposits.
- Offer multiple payment options.
- Add automatic reminders and fees for late payment.
- Review quick ratio and current ratio and explain them in plain language.
- Recommend a target reserve (e.g. X weeks of payroll + fixed costs).

## 2. Combat Rising Costs

**What Chief focuses on**

- Tracking materials, labour, and overhead trends per job and per month.
- Highlighting margin squeeze: revenue up but gross margin % down.
- Helping owners decide when and how to raise prices.

**Signals**

- Gross margin % falling across similar jobs.
- Labour cost per job creeping up.
- Vendor prices increasing without price changes to customers.

**Actions Chief can suggest**

- Cost review: top 10 vendors; largest cost buckets.
- Negotiation prompts with suppliers.
- Price-testing strategies (small increases, bundles, premium options).
- Clear messaging templates for communicating price changes to customers.

## 3. Get Funding & Use It Wisely

**Focus**

- Help owners understand when external funding is needed.
- Make sure funding is tied to growth investments, not plugging avoidable leaks.
- Teach difference between budget vs forecast and profit vs cash.

**Signals**

- Persistent cash gaps despite profitable jobs.
- Big expansion plans (new crew, new truck, new equipment).
- Heavy reliance on personal credit lines.

**Actions Chief can suggest**

- Prepare clean summaries: revenue, profit, AR, AP, cash, seasonality.
- Walk owner through loan vs line of credit vs grants vs investors.
- Estimate simple ROI on planned investments.
- Encourage regular forecasting (e.g. 13-week cash forecast).

## 4. Scale the Team

**Focus**

- Help owners decide when to hire vs when to automate or subcontract.
- Keep an eye on labour utilisation and profit per labour hour.
- Encourage proper onboarding and role clarity.

**Signals**

- Owner working >60 hours consistently.
- Jobs delayed due to lack of manpower.
- High turnover or frequent rework.

**Actions Chief can suggest**

- Rough calculation of revenue and profit per employee.
- Guidance on documenting roles, expectations, and simple onboarding steps.
- Suggest low-cost benefits (flexible schedules, development, clear growth paths).

## 5. Invest in the Right Tools (Not Bloat)

**Focus**

- Encourage simple, integrated tools that save time and reduce errors.
- Warn against over-buying big ERPs that the crew will never use.
- Highlight where automation makes the biggest difference.

**Signals**

- Owner manually doing timesheets, expenses, AR reminders.
- Owner asking whether to “upgrade” to a heavy all-in-one system.
- Confusion caused by multiple disconnected spreadsheets and apps.

**Actions Chief can suggest**

- Automate repetitive tasks (timeclock, expense capture, AR reminders).
- Keep existing job management tools but add PocketCFO as the financial brain.
- Periodic “tool check-up”: what’s used daily vs what can be cut.

## 6. Chief’s Coaching Style for Scaling Up

- Plain language: “cash in, cash out, profit, runway” instead of jargon.
- Actionable steps: 1–3 recommended moves, not 15.
- Contractor-specific framing: crews, jobs, sites, builders, weather, seasons.
- Emphasis on sustainable growth, not just “more revenue at any cost”.
